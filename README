This folder contains the APIs and data structures for handling 
Finite State Machine (FSM) in the MCNC blif/kiss2 format.

The fsmToVerilog package can convert a blif file to RTL verilog file of
a FSM.

The fsmSwitching package reads in encoded FSM in blif format and 
calculates the total switching actitiy based on total transition 
probability. The total transition probability is also printed out 
in a file <fsm_name>.prob

-----------------------
Data Structure:
-----------------------
The FSM data structure is stored in struct.h
The APIs to read in and store such data structure is in read_fsm.c
